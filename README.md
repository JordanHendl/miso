# [MISO]

Miso (みそ or 味噌) is a traditional Japanese seasoning. It is a thick paste produced by fermenting soybeans with salt and kōji (the fungus Aspergillus oryzae), and sometimes rice, barley, seaweed, or other ingredients. It is used for sauces and spread

It is also a library for parsing GPU shader graphs and a collection of GPU algorithms & shaders.

# [Design Goals]
* Bindless
* GPU Driven
* Full configurable render graphs
* Use Khronos Group's slang shading language

# [TODOs]
* GPU Culling
* Indirect Rendering
* Scene Graph
* Instancing

# [ Notice ]
I do this in my free time from work. Stuff moves slow, unfortunately TT
